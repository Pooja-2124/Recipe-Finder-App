### 📌 Tips:
- Make sure your Netlify link is working before adding it.
- Add screenshots for a more visual README.
- Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude things like `.DS_Store` or `node_modules` (if using tools later).

Would you like me to generate this file directly for your GitHub repo or help you add it via GitHub UI?
